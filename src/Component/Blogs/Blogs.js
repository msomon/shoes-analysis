      <p>Question-1:
      Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user.

        Question-2:
        semantic tagg tell the browser how to display the content on the page. semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, p tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them.By adding semantic HTML tags to your pages, you provide additional information that helps Google and Bing understand the roles and relative importance of the different parts of your page.

        Question-3:
        A block element always starts on a new line, and fills up the horizontal space left and right on the web page. You can add margins and padding on all four sides of any block element — top, right, left, and bottom.
        Some examples of block elements are div and  p tags.Inline elements dont start on a new line, they appear on the same line as the content and tags beside them. Some examples of inline elements are span , strong, and img tags.Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements, except they can have padding and margins added on all four sides. Youll have to declare display: inline-block in your CSS code.
